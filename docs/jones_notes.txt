611: Another peculiarity of the subsonic inviscid flow is the
complete lack of resistance associated with the thickness of
the bodies or wings. At supersonic speeds, however, such a
component of drag does arise and this drag appears in the
energy required for the continual extension of the wave
system.
???: At subsonic speeds the pressure drag arising from the thickness
of the body or wings is negligible so long as the shapes are
sufficiently well streamlined to avoid flow separation
 ---> There is no thickness drag at subsonic speeds

605: In Whitcomb's experiments it was demonstrated
further that the drag associated with the thicknesc of a
wing can be effectively suppressed by removing an
appropriate "area distribution" from the fuselage
 ---> The sears-haack body alone is a sufficient estimation of the wave (thickness) drag
